# Ruby provides a whole set of I/O related methods in the Kernel Module 
# Ruby module is like a Java interface

# the print method prints each parameter its passed to standard out (stdout)
# it does not append a new line to the end of its ouput
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"

# observations: arguements to the print method werren't enclosed in parenthesis
# delimiters like the semi colon were not needed at the end of the lines of code.
